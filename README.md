The district school board has discovered the test scores for the ninth grade students for Thomas High School maybe have been

## Summary

In my opinion it is difficult to determinte the exact results since the Thomas High School night grades were ommited and it is unknown what happened.  A more accurate data set would be more ideal and the results from a more clean data set could tell a different story.  The overall scores and rankings of Thomas High School decreased from the analysis, but this is due to having bad data for the night grade.
